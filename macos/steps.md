# Steps

- Start Mac
- Follow initial OS setup by choosing language, and also connecting to WiFi
  - You will also setup your username and password for your first account
  - You can also setup Touch ID with your finger print if you have a Touch Bar
    and a Touch ID feature
- After logging in for the first time, check for "Software Update" and use
  `Command + R` to refresh. Check the "Automatically keep my Mac up to date"
  option
- I use the Caps Lock Key as Escape Key so I went to "Keyboard" settings and
  clicked on "Modifier Keys" and for "Caps Lock" key I chose "Escape" as the
  action
- I have a Mac with Touch Bar so I had to choose options related to what should
  be shown on the Touch Bar. I chose to show F1, F2...F12 keys by default and if
  I click `Fn` key, it will show `Control Strip` for brightness, sound etc
  - [How?]
- Given this was my work laptop, I had to install web browsers since I hardly
  use Safari. I primarily use Firefox. Sometimes I use Chrome. Also, when
  working with Web Apps or using Web Apps, some Apps don't work at all in
  Firefox for some reason. Also, I usually keep my Firefox security pretty
  tight in terms of cookies, privacy, third party cookies, as much as possible.
  Chrome - since I rarely use it, I don't worry about configuring anything to
  keep the security tight. Some sites in fact don't work well when it's on
  tight security.
  - So, I opened up Safari, went to Chrome website and Firefox Developer Edition
    web page and downloaded the dmg file. In Chrome website I was asked if my
    Apple laptop had Intel chip or Apple chip. Mine was Intel so I chose that.
  - I installed both Chrome and Firefox by opening the dmg files and moving the
    Application to the Applications directory. I deleted the dmg files immediately
    and also ejected the volumes created by the dmg files.
  - On opening Firefox I was asked if it was okay to open it, due to security
    reasons. I chose "open"
- On opening Firefox I realized I couldn't use my usual shortcut
  `Command + Option + F` to have Full Screen being used by the Firefox window.
  So I had to double click the Firefox top bar. I also noticed that my Dock was
  always in a visible state. I right clicked on it to choose "Turn Hiding On"
  and the Dock was hidden.
- For using shortcuts to control the placement of my windows - full screen,
center, left, right etc, I use Spectacle App. https://www.spectacleapp.com/.
It's open source. I got that then.
